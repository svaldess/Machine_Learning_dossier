# Machine Learning Projects

This repo has some of my Machine Learning projects, including:

## 1) Understanding recidivism
This jupyter notebook explores how prediction new offenses committed by offenders based on their previous offense, the type of release (parole, parole to detainer, etc),
and demographical features of the offender (age, sex, race/ethnicity, etc). **Scikit-Learn** was used. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models were explored.
Hperparameter tuning was performed and the F1 Scores of the models were estimated.
