# Machine Learning Projects

This repo has some of my Machine Learning projects, including:

## 1) Understanding recidivism: a logistic regression model for clasifying new offenses
This jupyter notebook explores how prediction new offenses committed by offenders based on categorical features such as their previous offense, the type of release (parole, parole to detainer, etc),
and demographical features of the offender (age, sex, race/ethnicity, etc) in Iowa, USA. **Scikit-Learn** was used for this project. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models were explored. Hyperparameter tuning was performed and the F1 Scores of the models were estimated. 

## 2) Predicting temperature with a linear regression model 
This notebook explores the possibility of predicting the temperature in a given day based on numerical features such as precipitation, humidity, wind speed, among others. Hyperparameter tuning is used to compare the prediction given by regression models with different types regularization: Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net. 
**Scikit-Learn** was use for this project.
