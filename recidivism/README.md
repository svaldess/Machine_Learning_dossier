# Understanding recidivism: a logistic regression model for clasifying new offenses

This jupyter notebook explores how prediction new offenses committed by offenders based on categorical features such as their previous offense, 
the type of release (parole, parole to detainer, etc), and demographical features of the offender (age, sex, race/ethnicity, etc) in Iowa, USA. 
Scikit-Learn was used for this project. 

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest models were explored. Hyperparameter tuning was performed and the F1 Scores of the models were estimated.
